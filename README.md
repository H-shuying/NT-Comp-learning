# NT-Comp-learning
This is the reproduced code for learning from triplet comparisons data (Tcopm) in the paper *"Binary Classification from N-Tuple Comparisons Data."*  

- **`algorithms.py`** implements the linker for the Tcopm learning risk estimator.  
- **`utils_loss.py`** contains the data preprocessing implementation based on public datasets.  
- To execute the code, please run **`main.py`**.

# Required
-Python 3.6.2
-numpy   1.19.5
-scikit-learn   0.24.2
-torch   1.10.2
